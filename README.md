# Topic Modeling with NLP

This repository provides Python implementations for discovering topics in text data using NLP models.

## Purpose:

* Finds hidden themes within text documents.
* Organizes and summarizes large amounts of text.
* Helps understand the main ideas present in a collection of texts.

## Implementation:

* Uses Python libraries like `gensim` and `scikit-learn`.
* Includes models like LDA and NMF.
* Provides basic text processing (tokenization, etc.).
* Offers visualizations of topics.

## Usage:

1.  Install Python libraries.
2.  Prepare your text data.
3.  Run the Python scripts.
4.  View the generated topics and visualizations.

## Key Concepts:

* **Topic Modeling:** Finding groups of related words in text.
* **LDA/NMF:** Algorithms to discover topics.
* **Text Processing:** Cleaning and preparing text for analysis.

## Output:

* Lists of words for each topic.
* Visualizations (word clouds).
* Topic distributions per document.
