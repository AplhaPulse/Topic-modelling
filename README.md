# Topic Modeling with NLP

This repository provides Python implementations for discovering topics in text data using NLP models.

## Purpose

- Identifies hidden themes within text documents.
- Organizes and summarizes large amounts of text.
- Helps understand the main ideas present in a collection of texts.

## Implementation

- Utilizes Python libraries such as `gensim` and `scikit-learn`.
- Includes models like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization).
- Provides basic text processing techniques (e.g., tokenization).
- Offers visualizations of topics.

## Usage

1. Install the required Python libraries.
2. Prepare your text data.
3. Execute the provided Python scripts.
4. Review the generated topics and visualizations.

## Key Concepts

- **Topic Modeling:** Technique for finding groups of related words in text.
- **LDA/NMF:** Algorithms used to discover topics.
- **Text Processing:** Cleaning and preparing text for analysis.

## Output

- Lists of words for each topic.
- Visualizations (e.g., word clouds).
- Topic distributions for each document.
